			<li>What is the most helpful frame here? Do the superclusters translate to policy interventions or is it the age/education matrix?</li> 
			<li>How important are the details of the individual clusters for a given place? If the policy levers derive from the more coarse set of groups (superclusters or age/education groupings), how necessary are the details of the specific clusters? My sense is that the details of each cluster are useful to validate and/or revise the policy recommendations. But, what would a place do if the details of one or more clusters don't seem to jibe with the superset? Of course, the details are interesting for data/policy wonks and that may be sufficient argument for providing the details. Either way, the details should be a "second layer" to the presentation that can be ignored by the reader.</li>
			<li>How do we handle the two primary age group divisions (18-24 and 25-64)?</li>
