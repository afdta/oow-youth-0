Hi Alec,

Super convenient time for webmail to be down...

Was just sending this to you:

So sorry again for the delay getting things to you. GIS is not cooperating (broken record, I know), so I've not been able to export the counties shapefile, but the places shapefile is all set.

I've again uploaded everything to this box.com folder: https://app.box.com/s/a0yps0zi39zf5wygz1lwm7wxzmkh9yoa

There are four csv files:
- topline descriptive statistics 25-64, which contains "universe" (i.e., all non-inst civilians 25-64) and "sample" descriptive stats for all jurisdictions, as well as the aggregated geos of interest and nation
- PUMA to geo xwalk, which is a crosswalk between PUMAs, their assigned jurisdiction ("FIPS_final"), and their display jurisdiction (i.e., city or county; "display_geo")
- cluster, supercluster data, which contains descriptive stats for superclusters (across all places), jurisdiction-level cluster descriptive stats, and jurisdiction-level descriptive stats (which duplicates jurisdiction-level sample population stats in the topline file)
- cluster, supercluster distribution by puma, which shows the percentage of a cluster or supercluster within a jurisdiction that falls in a given PUMA

There are three sets of shapefiles:
- Export_Output is a shapefile of primary cities; there are 24 jurisdictions whose "display_geo" ID relates to this file
- mergedshapefile is a shapefile of all PUMAs in the US
- higgins geos is a shapefile of PUMAs aggregated to the geos of interest

I think that's all for now... please let me know if you have trouble with anything, or if it would be helpful for me to move things around.

Thank you!!
Natalie

And then a followup later

FYI I just added one more csv to the box folder, with the distribution of superclusters by geo--i.e., % that is in supercluster 1, 2, etc. (Sums to 100% within each place). Not sure if you need it, but it struck me that I'd neglected to include it before!
